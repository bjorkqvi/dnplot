# dnplot 💻

**dnplot** is a tool designed for the visualization of [**dnora**](https://github.com/MET-OM/dnora) objects, such as 🌬️ wind, 🌊 wave and ocean current data.

## Quick Installation 🚀 

Ready to dive in? You can easily install **dnplot** using pip:

```shell
$ pip install dnplot 
```

## Examples

To quickly visualize the wave data outputted by SWAN to a netcdf file:

```python
import dnplot
from dnora.wavegrid import WaveGrid

data = WaveGrid.from_netcdf('model_output.nc')
point = data.sel(lon=5.25, lat=62.3, method='nearest') # Pick just one point

# The dict could be a dnora ModelRun object containing the data
plot = dnplot.Matplotlib({'wavegrid': data, 'waveseries': point})

# default value for var=["hs", ("tm01", "tm02"), "dirm"] 
plot.waveseries(var=['hs', ('tp','tm01'), 'dirp']) 
plot.wavegrid('hs', contour=False)
```

To interactively compare spectra from a model with several locations with buoy measurements:

```python
import dnora as dn
import dnplot

model = dn.modelrun.ModelRun(year=2020)
model.import_spectra(filename="nora3.nc", name="NORA3")
model.spectra_to_1d()

buoy = dn.modelrun.ModelRun(year=2020, month=2, day=5)
buoy.import_spectra1d(filename="spec_E39_D_1h.nc", name="Breisundet")

plot = dnplot.Plotly(buoy, model)
plot.spectra()
```
